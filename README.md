#Problem Statement

Motion detection using Opencv

#Introduction

Surveillance is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. Motion Detector takes input from video sources such as network cameras, web cams, files, etc. and makes intelligent decisions based on analyzing frames. The primary focus of Motion Detector is efficient video processing, fault tolerance and extensibility. 
Motion sensing is a process of change in position of the object related to its surrounding or vice versa. Motion Detection of human has a very wide area of applications. In many applications based on machine vision, motion detection is used. For example, when we want to count the people who pass by a certain place or how many cars have passed through a toll. In all these cases, the first thing we have to do is extract the people or vehicles that are at the scene.
