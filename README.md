#Problem Statement

Motion detection using Opencv

#Introduction

Surveillance is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. Motion Detector takes input from video sources such as network cameras, web cams, files, etc. and makes intelligent decisions based on analyzing frames. The primary focus of Motion Detector is efficient video processing, fault tolerance and extensibility. 
Motion sensing is a process of change in position of the object related to its surrounding or vice versa. Motion Detection of human has a very wide area of applications. In many applications based on machine vision, motion detection is used. For example, when we want to count the people who pass by a certain place or how many cars have passed through a toll. In all these cases, the first thing we have to do is extract the people or vehicles that are at the scene.
 
Requirements:
1.	Python integrated development environment
2.	OpenCV(libraries)
    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for       computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
3.	Pandas(libraries) 
    Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow     you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.
4. Imutils(liberaries)
    imutils are a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib         images easier with OpenCV
